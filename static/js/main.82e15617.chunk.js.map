These conversations might feel uncomfortable or unproductive if we aren't sure how to approach them.\n\n                We've created Persuasion to help players discover and practice how they might approach more polarized conversations through a risk-free, playful game space. Through this game, we hope players will feel comfortable being silly and trying different conversation strategies--good or bad--that they might never otherwise use, and learn more about how different ways of framing views can affect others!\n\n                Keep on reading to learn how to play!\n\n              <pre></pre>\n              <div>\n                <div id=\"howtoplay\">Players</div>\n                This game may be played with any number of players.
